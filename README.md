# Project Description

This repository contains the code for the **Reproducible Research** project, where we try to port R code into Python and make the process reproducible.  
 This README.md file provides instructions on how to replicate the project environment and general findings.

# Replicating the Environment

To replicate the project environment, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/LukaszPienkowski/RR_2023_Project_LP_AN_JM.git
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment for the project. You can use `venv` or any other virtual environment tool of your choice. Here's an example using `venv`:

    ```
    python3 -m venv myenv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment.

- For Windows (Command Prompt):
  ```
  myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
  ```

- For Unix or Linux:
  ```
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
